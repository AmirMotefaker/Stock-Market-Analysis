Fortunately the decryption keys are available, although Yahoo moved/changed them several times hence yfinance breaking several times. yfinance is now better prepared for any future changes by Yahoo.\n\n- Why is Yahoo doing this? We don't know. Is it to stop scrapers? Maybe, so we've implemented changes to reduce load on Yahoo. In December we rolled out version 0.2 with optimised scraping. Then in 0.2.6 introduced Ticker.fast_info, providing much faster access to some Ticker.info elements wherever possible e.g. price stats and forcing users to switch (sorry but we think necessary).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# real-time stock market data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nstart_date = datetime.now() - pd.DateOffset(months=3)\nend_date = datetime.now()\n\ntickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'NFLX', 'GOOG']\n# Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, and Google\n\ndf_list = []\n\nfor ticker in tickers:\n    data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)\n    df_list.append(data)\n\ndf = pd.concat(df_list, keys=tickers, names=['Ticker', 'Date'])\nprint(df.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T09:37:01.610948Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T09:37:01.611299Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T09:37:03.442905Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-14T09:37:01.61126Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-14T09:37:03.441749Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Index column in the DataFrame","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = df.reset_index()\nprint(df.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T09:37:03.444407Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T09:37:03.445221Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T09:37:03.456321Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-14T09:37:03.445188Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-14T09:37:03.455223Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Stock Market","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import plotly.express as px\nfig = px.line(df, x='Date', \n              y='Close', \n              color='Ticker', \n              title=\"Stock Market Performance for the Last 3 Months\")\nfig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T09:37:03.457611Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T09:37:03.457963Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.063233Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-14T09:37:03.457936Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.062182Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Compare the Performance of Companies\n\n- look at the faceted area chart, which makes it easy to compare the performance of different companies and identify similarities or differences in their stock price movements:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.area(df, x='Date', y='Close', color='Ticker',\n              facet_col='Ticker',\n              labels={'Date':'Date', 'Close':'Closing Price', 'Ticker':'Company'},\n              title='Stock Prices for Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, and Google')\nfig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.066336Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.066706Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.210843Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.066665Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.209739Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Analyze Moving Averages\n\n- analyze moving averages, which provide a useful way to identify trends and patterns in each company’s stock price movements over a period of time:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df['MA10'] = df.groupby('Ticker')['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean().reset_index(0, drop=True)\ndf['MA20'] = df.groupby('Ticker')['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean().reset_index(0, drop=True)\n\nfor ticker, group in df.groupby('Ticker'):\n    print(f'Moving Averages for {ticker}')\n    print(group[['MA10', 'MA20']])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.212316Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.212776Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.246783Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.212735Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.245453Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Visualize the Moving Averages\n\n- how to visualize the moving averages of all companies:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for ticker, group in df.groupby('Ticker'):\n    fig = px.line(group, x='Date', y=['Close', 'MA10', 'MA20'], \n                  title=f\"{ticker} Moving Averages\")\n    fig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.248332Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.248991Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.545782Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.248956Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-14T09:37:06.544812Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### The output shows four separate graphs for each company.
